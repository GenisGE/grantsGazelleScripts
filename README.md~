# Scripts used on the analysis of RAD-sequence data of Grant's gazelle

These are the scripts used to perform the analyses in the paper "Admixture and the road to speciation in an African gazelle" CHANGE IF TITLE CHANGES

I provide the scripts as they are, if you want to use them you will have to change paths and probably fix issues. If you have any questions please contact me thorugh github or at genis.erill@bio.ku.dk

## Software needed

```
SAMTOOLS #link
ANGSD
PLINK
PCANGSD # we used old v1 with different output format than v2, you can download it from
NGSADMIX
EVALADMIX
TREEMIX
QPGRAPH
FASTSIMCOAL2
NGSREALTE2
```

# Steps

### 1. HWE test (ANGSD + PCANGSD)

```
# First do genotype likelihood file that will be used as input for pcangsd with
scripts/do_beagle_for_hwe_test.sh
# This will generate output.beagle.gz file that can be used as input for pcangsd to do HWE test in the following script
scripts/do_hwe_filter_pcangsd.sh
# This generates out.lrt and out.sites files. Identify those sites where lrt > 24 and exclude them from all subsequent analyses
```


### 2. Estimate relatedness with a. ngsRelatev2 b. allele frequency method (angsd+realSFS+Rscript)

```
# a. Run ngsRelate
scripts/run_ngsRelate.sh

# b. Allele frequency free method. Frist estimate 2DSFS between pairs we want to estiamte relatednes
scripts/do_relatedness_ratios.sh
# b. Use Rscript to calculate relatedness ratios from individuals 2dsfs. 
Rscript scripts/calc_ratios.R indsIDs
```


### 3. Population structure: PCAngsd, NGSadmix and evalAdmix
```
# 1. Make genotype beagle file with hwe filter to use in following analyses
scripts/do_beagle_to_use.sh

# 2. Perform PCA with PCAngsd
scripts/do_pca_pcangsd.sh

# 3. Run NGSAdmix
scripts/do_ngsadmix.sh K # K is the number of ancestral populations you want to assume. We did from 2 to 9, only 2 to 7 converged

# 4. Run evalAdmix (you need first to select best likelihood ngsadmix results for each K to use as input)
scripts/evalNGSadmixGrants.sh
```

### 4. Infer population 2DSFS and 3DSFS, and estimate global Fst from 2DSFS
```
# 4a. Do consensus fasta file from thomsons gazelle to use for polarizying 3DSFs
scripts/do_fasta_thomson.sh
# 4b. Estimate 2DSFS and global Fst between all pop pairs, estimate two 3DSFS for demographic inference
scripts/do_sfss.sh

```

### 5. Estimate heterozygosities
```
#5a. Generate individual SFS for all inds
scripts/do_heterozygosities.sh
#5b. Use individual SFS to esitmate heterozygosity ( uses Rscript in scripts/calc_h.R) 
scripts/extract_heterozygosity.sh
```

### 6. Estimate Fst per chromosome
```
# Estimate dephts in chromosome 1 and X, to infer sex of each individual
scripts/do_depths_checkSex.sh
# Estimate per chromosome Fst using only males (to avoid ploidy issues in X chromomosme)
scripts/doFstByChrOnlyMalesNoRecAdmx.sh
# Combine all estiamtedscripts/do_fasta_thomson.sh Fst in single file
scripts/joinAllChrFst.sh
# Do global Fst using only males
scripts/doFstAutosomeOnlyMales.sh
```

### 7. Call genotypes
```
scripts/call_genotypes.sh
# ... Do many filtering steps with plink to generate desired substes of files and individuals in .bed format...

# convert to input format for treemix and qpgrpah
# treemix (calls scripts/FreqsToTreemixCounts.R)
scripts/plink_to_treemix.sh 
# qpgraph (eigenstrat format, calls scripts/par.PED.EIGENSTRAT)
scripts/plinkToEigenstrat.sh
```

### 8. Run treemix
```
scripts/run_treemix.sh
```


### 9. Run qpgraph
```
scripts/runqpGraph.sh model # calls scripts/parQPgraph and model.graph. Models used in scripts/qpgraphmodels

```


### 10. Run fastsimcoal
```

```


### 11. Dstats
```
# R functions used in
scripts/DstatsFuns.R

```
